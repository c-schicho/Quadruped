# robot_open-quadruped

The project is based on the hardware of the open-quadruped (https://github.com/adham-elarabawy/open-quadruped). 
This is an open-source 3D-printed quadrupedal robot.

# Planed Features

Firstly, I need to make the robot walk. This is the short-term goal for the following weeks.
# Documentation

In order to make this project accessible to everyone. I will try to document this project as good as possible

You will find the documentation in the docs folder. 

# Hardware

For this project I used an Nvidia Jetson-Nano in combination with an Adafruit PCA9685. 
These two components are responsible for driving the servos.

I will add some further information about the hardware and the wiring in the future. 
You will find these information in the hardware folder soon.
