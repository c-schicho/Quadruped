# robot_open-quadruped

This project is based on the 3D-parts of the open-quadruped (https://github.com/adham-elarabawy/open-quadruped). 
The open-quadruped is an open-source 3D-printed quadrupedal robot.

The purpose of this project is to develop the entire software for this quadruped. 
Additionally I will try to document my thoughts and the whole progress in order to make it accessible to others.
