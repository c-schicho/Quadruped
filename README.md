# robot_open-quadruped

This project is based on the 3D-parts of the open-quadruped (https://github.com/adham-elarabawy/open-quadruped). 
The open-quadruped is an open-source 3D-printed quadrupedal robot.

The purpose of this project is to develop the entire software for this quadruped. 
Additionally I will try to document my thoughts and the whole progress in order to make it accessible to others. 

# Planed Features

First of all I need to make the robot walk. This is the short-term goal for the following weeks.

# Documentation

In order to make this project accessible to everyone. I will try to document this project as good as possible

You will find the documentation in the docs folder. 

# Hardware

For this project I used an Nvidia Jetson-Nano in combination with an Adafruit PCA9685. 
These two components are responsible for driving the servos.

I will add some further information about the hardware and the wiring in the future. 
You will find these information in the hardware folder soon.


### This project is still in progress.
