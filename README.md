# Robot Open Quadruped

This project is based on the 3D-parts of the open-quadruped (https://github.com/adham-elarabawy/open-quadruped). 
The open-quadruped is an open-source 3D-printed quadrupedal robot.

The purpose of this project is to develop the entire software for this quadruped. 
Additionally I will try to document my thoughts and the whole progress in order to make it accessible to others. 


# Planed Features

- [ ] Finish the inverse kinematic documentation
- [ ] Finish the simulation in gazebo
- [ ] Prgram the gait planning script
- [ ] Finish the gait planning documentation
- [ ] Develop a strategy for the deep learning algorthmn 
- [ ] Train the algorithmn
- [ ] Deploy it on the real robot
- [ ] Add an intel realsense to the project


# Documentation
In this section I will collect all of my papers concerning this project. 


# Hardware
