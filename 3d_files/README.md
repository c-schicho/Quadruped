# 3D Files

In this section I provide my custom 3D .stl files for the open-quadruped project. 
In the folder "custom_parts" you will find the following parts:

<b>Custom Front Cover</b>
<br>I adopted the design of the original file in order to be able to mount an intel realsense t265 and a d415. This design allows you to mount both cameras simultaneously. Also I added a whole on the side for the usb cables.

<b>Custome Rear Cover</b>
<br>I added a hole for a power switch.  


<b>Custom Top Cover and Top Plate</b>
<br>I changed the design in oder to be able to maintain the electrical equipment without the need of dissasambling the robot. 

<b>Jetson Plate</b>
<br>This is a replacement for the original file. This plate is able to hold the nvidia jetson nano (even with an active fan), the adafruit pca9685 pwm servo driver and a dc to dc stepdown converter.
