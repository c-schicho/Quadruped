# 3D Files

In this section I provide my custom 3D .stl files for the open-quadruped project. 
In the folder "custom_parts" you will find the following parts:

## Custom Front Cover
I adopted the design of the original file in order to be able to mount an intel realsense t265 and a d415. This design allows you to mount both cameras simultaneously. Also I added a whole on the side for the usb cables.

## Custome Rear Cover
I added a hole for a power switch.  


## Custom Top Cover and Top Plate
I changed the design in oder to be able to maintain the electrical equipment without the need of dissasambling the robot. 

## Jetson Plate
This is a replacement for the original file. This plate is able to hold the nvidia jetson nano (even with an active fan), the adafruit pca9685 pwm servo driver and a dc to dc stepdown converter.
